# Description:

1. When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
2. When a user scrolls down, the time blocks for standard business hours are presented to them, and they are colour coded to show whether they reflect the past, present or future time.
3. When a time block is clicked on, a user can input an event. Once the save button or icon is clicked, that event is saved into the local storage.
4. When the page is refreshed, these saved events persist.
